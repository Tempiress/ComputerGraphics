- GrehemAlgorithm
- midpoint displacement


## BrezenhaimAlgorithm
The Bresenham's line algorithm is an algorithm that determines which points of a two—dimensional raster need to be colored in order to get a close approximation of a straight line between two given points. The algorithm is widely used, in particular, for drawing lines on a computer screen.

## GrehemAlgorithm
Graham's algorithm is an algorithm for constructing a convex hull in two—dimensional space.

## midpoint displacement
Midpoint Displacement is a simple algorithm for generating realistic looking height ranges.
It is a recursive algorithm that subdivides a line into segments, adding a decreasing amount of randomness at each round.
